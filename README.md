# FileFinder

FileFinder is a tool I'm developing to search for one or more files within a given directory. While there are faster and better solutions out there, I'm customizing this program to meet my needs while learning about MVVM ;)

- **Search for files based on filenames**
- **Parallelization of the search process**
- **Actions on the search results**
  - Open
  - Copy
- **Filtering options**
  - Include/exclude subfolders
  - Include only specific file types

- **Save and select previous search directories**
