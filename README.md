# FileFinder

FileFinder is a tool I'm developing to search for a specific text (regex) within text files in a given directory. While there are faster and better solutions out there, I'm customizing this program to meet my needs while learning about MVVM ;)

# (Planned) Features

- **Parallelization of the search process**
- **Filtering options**
  - Include/exclude subfolders
  - Search by specific file types
  - Search by specific file names
- **Actions on the search results**
  - Open
  - Copy
- **Faster path selection** using a directory viewer
- **Save and select previous search directories**
